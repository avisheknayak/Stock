Since it is a linear prediction of either rise or fall so we need a linear algorithm which can fit our model.
Stock prediction with the help of Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine Algorithms in Machine Learning
The dataset used is of Nike Inc.
About 1000 data is present is the csv file 
80% of the data is used for training purpose and 20% of the data is used for the predicton purposes
One can give manual input to the machine learning model i,e the numbe rod day for which they want the prediction an dget the respective graph
for better visualization purposes.
